## Objectives for this course
This course introduces the aspiring Android developer to the fundamental concepts needed to make their own full fledged Android apps. We will explore most of these concepts through several projects (apps) that students can add to their personal projects portfolio. Students will become well versed with Version Control Systems (VCS) like [git](https://www.learnenough.com/git-tutorial) as well as using the [commandLine](https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial) like a pro. Furthermore, although not required, students are expected to invest their personal time in learning Java since all the projects will be coded in Java. All the material and links required for this course will be posted on this site under the schedule.
