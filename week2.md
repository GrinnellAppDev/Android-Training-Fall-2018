#### Course Instructor: Tapiwa Zvidzwa
#### Location: Noyce 3820
#### Time: Thur 7 - 8pm

## Objectives for this course
This course introduces the aspiring Android developer to the fundamental concepts needed to make their own full fledged Android apps. We will explore most of these concepts through several projects (apps) that students can add to their personal projects portfolio. Students will become well versed with Version Control Systems (VCS) like [git](https://www.learnenough.com/git-tutorial) as well as using the [commandLine](https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial) like a pro. Furthermore, although not required, students are expected to invest their personal time in learning Java since all the projects will be coded in Java. All the material and links required for this course will be posted on this site under the schedule.

#### Push your very first Android app to github (You will remember this 5 years from now)
- Open your github account using your browser
- Create a new git repository
- Give it the name: Android-hello-world-app
- Do not edit the README.md file for now
- Finish creating the repo
- Copy the link to the repo, mine looks like this: https://github.com/Tapszvidzwa/Android-hello-world-app.git
- In Android Studio, open your terminal and follow the commands below

#### For the next steps, if you have forgotten the git commands, first trying using [this](https://www.learnenough.com/git-tutorial) as a cheat sheet, otherwise call Tapiwa :)
- Initialize a git repo
- Add all the files to that repo
- Commit the files with the message "My First App"
- Using the link you copied from github, add a remote branch called origin
- Push all the code to your github, since this is the first time pushing to this remote branch, make sure to include the flag to start tracking updates to that branch

## Exercise (Due next week: Start early)
- Build a story app - (To be discussed in class). Make sure to create a github repo for your app (I check these)
